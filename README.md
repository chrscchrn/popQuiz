# popQuiz
A short quiz about web development!

This quiz contains four questions I found interesting about web development. Utilizing DOM manipulation, buttons pop up at the appropriate time whether there is a question being answered or its time to begin the quiz. The user can expect to save their high score but only if it is higher than the previous ones. If you get all four points you won the game! Once this happens it is no longer possible to save any more high scores.
